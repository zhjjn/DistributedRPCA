models first?

Tools
======

x- sklearn api intro
x- train / test cross validation
x- gridsearchcv
x- pipeline
x- scoring metrics

- bayesian optimization? (ready yet?)

x- out of core
x- custom estimators

- DAG -> DASK

Algorithms
==========
x- linear models for regression
x- path algorithms / cv objects
x- kernel SVMs
x- kernel approximation?
x- decision trees
x- random forests
x- gradient boosting

x - outlier detection (iforest, one class svm, robust pca?) (!!!!!)

x - PCA
x - NMF 
x - robust PCA on timeseries?
x - TSNE

x - Feature selection: do greedy forward and backward?
x - feature engineering

x - GP
x - Neural Networks (needs dev version!)


"externals":
============
neural networks? keras
mlxtend?
xgboost (with python bindings?) [pip install xgboost]
bayesian optimization?
robust PCA
keras? (pip install keras - uses theano)
